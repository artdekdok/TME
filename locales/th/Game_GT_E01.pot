All morning they've been going on and on about their \"\"camping trip\"\" with Auntie Tessa and all the s'mores they ate and bugs they caught. I can't remember the last time they were both this happy at the same time (usually it's one happy, the other one crying). <lf>I know you're busy with the store and getting ready to be First Lady :) so thanks for making time for them and so sorry about the last minute drop off (you know how work has been!)<lf>The girls say ‘We love you, Auntie Tessa!!!’<lf>PS: You and Tom should come for dinner sometime!

It has been nine (9) days and I still haven't had any mail. My granddaughter Madison is on her honeymoon at Great House Resort in Jamaica (Ricky does computer work). She said she would write and you know Madison keeps her word. <lf>I have called every day for NINE DAYS and everytime Rose makes some kind of excuse. If this is because I didn't write the recommendation for her son tell her that has nothing to do with doing her job. <lf>Stealing my mail may not seem like much to you, but getting away with crime makes the criminal more bold. How soon before you are after the \"\"mailbox killer?\"\" <lf>I remind you we donate to the Policemans fund every year and it isn't easy for us but we do it because we believe in law enforcement unlike some others. But if this is the type of service we can expect, perhaps the firefighters could use our support.<lf><lf>Warmly,<lf>Laura Ann"

msgid "\"\"I need to know what the secret was,\"\" said one of the goblins. \"\"Let's go buy it.\"\" So, the goblins approached the Secret Keeper before she could stow away Moose's secret. \"\"We want to buy Moose’s secret.\"\" \"\"What do you have to trade?\"\" asked the Secret Keeper, her Voice filling their minds. The goblins produced a silver-handled hairbrush they had stolen from the Princess, and the Secret Keeper nodded. And that is how the goblins came to know that Moose's mate had tumbled down a cliffside to her death.<lf>The Secret Keeper moved on. The first of the goblins said, \"\"I want to know more!\"\" So, the goblins followed the Secret Keeper, hoping to find where she hid the secrets. They followed her to the peak of a nearby ridge and watched as she stowed the rest of the day's secrets high in a cloud. When she had gone, they climbed a high spruce tree that disappeared into the misty sky. They reached out and just managed to dip their hands into the clouds. Their heads were filled with memories, and they snatched their hands back out, as if they had just thrust them in boiling water. Tears poured down their cheeks. That was how the Secret Keeper found them, crying in the tree."

You’ll have to offer more than that!\"\" \"\"What if,\"\" said the Secret Keeper, “I shared the Gift of Voice.” The Crafty Goblins grew excited. \"\"That will do!\"\" So, the Secret Keeper shared the gift of Voice with the goblins, and immediately they found that they could hear one another’s thoughts and feel each other's feelings.  The Crafty Goblins gave back the secrets they had taken and ran back to the big wooden house."

This is the same, except you can understand what I say, and now you find it irritating. But I can’t change what I am, can I?

That ends tonight.” She cast a powerful spell that made the Ice King slow to react, and then gave the signal. “Mad Hunter!” she cried. “Let your arrow fly!”<lf>Nothing happened.

After Moose left, Old Bear said to the goblins, “Be sure to tell the Princess I was kind to you, and don’t steal my fish again.”<lf>The goblins, still hungry, went out looking for one more meal. They crept up to the Mangy Muskrat’s lodge and began to climb inside when they were dragged right back out. The Stalwart Moose dangled them by the seats of their pants and said, “Now, I know Mangy Muskrat didn’t tell you that you could eat his food, because he blames you for his coat being ruined. Besides, he barely has enough for himself and doesn’t share with anyone.” The goblins began to protest, but he shook his head. He set the goblins down and said, “Come with me.”"

Frog nodded and the Moose sighed. “Alright then,” he said, and he had to let the goblins go.<lf>Their next stop was the river. They watched as Old Bear swiped at a leaping salmon, catching it deftly in his large paws. He lay it out upon a rock and left it to dry, lumbering into the woods to seek out some berries.

We didn’t realize you were about to hibernate, and then we couldn’t bear to tell you what we’d done…” The Old Bear was angry at the trick, but the young goblins looked appropriately ashamed, and so he said, “Come with me.”<lf>He led the Crafty Goblins to the hollow in which he had hibernated for the winter. “You two can have this spot,” he said. “And look.” Someone had built a big wooden house right over top it. “No one lives there now,” said Old Bear, “but one day, maybe someone will.” The earthen hollow was not as beautiful as the ice cave, but it kept the goblins warm and dry, and they were excited that someday, they might have someone living overhead. Someone who baked cakes and tolerated their mischief.<lf>And that is the story of how the Crafty Goblins tried to steal the cave of the Old Bear, and how they got their own instead."

He threw his body against it with an impressive THUD. The impact moved the post, but too far, and it ended up bent the other direction."

Her first words startled the Princess, “The Mad Hunter is always at my heels. Now you’re safe, and I’ve had my revenge. You can stay in this house.

They sat by the river with the Muskrat, listening as he talked in great detail about his old coat, and then they did their best to point out all of the things that were still handsome about him, like his proud whiskers and sparkling eyes. They let the Very Old Beaver rest while they repaired all the damage done to her den, and then finally, they removed every burr from Old Bear’s fur, even the ones that were hopelessly tangled."

She had made it through the woods and to that house with nothing left but the clothes on her back and a single item from her old life: a splendid tiara. She lost almost everything in her desperate flight from the Mad Hunter. The trees tore the rucksack from her back and shredded her dress and left a pattern of red welts on her skin, but through it all, she clutched the tiara close to her chest, fearing any misstep could cause it to fall from her arms and break.<lf>The tiara had its own spot in the big wooden house: a pillow near the window, where sun would catch on its surface to shine and wink. The Princess could stare for hours at the tiara, marveling in its beauty and running her thumb down its curves. Every morning, she would wake, and she would tend to it, polishing its every surface to be sure it shone as brightly as it possibly could. Then she would pluck it up, place it upon her head, and walk the woods, feeling somehow more complete. Because what, after all, was a Princess without a crown? Every night, she would place it upon its pillow, give it a quick kiss, and go to bed. On her way, she would pause and glance back to be sure it was still there. She hated to be separated from it, but she knew it was safest on the pillow while she slept."

She was walking fast through the woods, as if she was running away, and she never looked back. Many eyes spied the Princess pass by, but no one dared to help her, for the Mad Hunter was on her trail. “This is not our business,” they said, “and we had better look away,” for the Mad Hunter was an unyielding man who loved nothing but hunting down prey for money and glory. Nothing could escape his Piercing Eye for long."

You’re a bear, I’m a Princess, it would never work.” The Old Bear was crushed. “Can we still be friends?” he asked. “We will always be friends,” said the Princess, “but I will never marry you.” <lf>The Old Bear and the Princess carried on their friendship, and after one year, he tried again to ask her to be his bride, but once again, she refused him. This happened one year later, and one year after that, and then finally the Princess said, “Old Bear, you are my dear friend, and I appreciate all you have done for me, but I would sooner you have left me to the wolves than marry you, and that is how it will always be. I have my hands full with the two goblins who live under my house, and they are all I need.” That wounded the Old Bear deeply, but it was finally enough to stop his proposals. They remained friends, and he continued to give her gifts of fresh salmon and ripe berries and newly bloomed bluebells, but the Old Bear never again asked the Princess to be his bride, much as he might have wanted to.<lf>And that is how the Princess befriended the Old Bear, and how she refused him."

The old seal went mad, and her anger heated the water of the lake around her. <lf>For a time, everyone was happy with the temperature change, for the weather suddenly became sweeter and the air warmer. But after a few weeks, things started to get ugly. First, the fish began to die off, for they could not live in the hot water.

The troll peered at them. They weren’t supposed to be happy about being in the cook pot, but they certainly looked like they were. “Troll,” said the goblins, “if your back is hurting, you should try sitting in the water. Just for a little bit.

But then, small items started to disappear as well: spoons and plates, forks and knifes. And blankets.

And as she searched, food kept on disappearing, night after night. “I will make a cake,” frowned the Princess. “A big cake, with every egg and fruit and nut I still have, so that I only have one thing to keep my eye on.” She spent the whole day making the cake and using everything she had left."

Exhausted, she pressed on with no idea of where she was heading, as the Hunter drew ever closer, dogged in his pursuit.

A few minutes later, she reached the Big Frog in the small pond, and the frog looked at her with a gentle smile.<lf>“Help me, please,” said the Princess. “I need a place to rest and to hide.” “Ribbit,” answered the Frog, and the Princess frowned. “Please, stop making noise. The Mad Hunter is after me.” “RIBBIT,” said the Frog again, so loud that the Princess had to cover her ears. The creature began to jump every which way. “What are you doing?” asked the Princess. “Stop all that noise, or he will find us!” But the Frog kept croaking and jumping around her, left and right, up and down, “Ribbit! Ribbit!” Until the Princess understood the meaning of all this fuss. Cautiously, the woman climbed on the back of the big animal, and then with a leap, the Frog set off away from the pond. The Frog jumped so high and so far, that even the Hunter could not find where the Princess had gone. With a few jumps, the Princess was out of his Piercing Eye. A few jumps more, and she had vanished for good. The Princess closed her eyes and let her clever mount carry her wherever the creature pleased."

But in the forest, word travels fast, and everyone has a story to tell. <lf><lf>The Big Frog, being who she was, gossiped and gossiped about everything she overheard. She told the bees that Old Bear had stolen their precious honey two years ago, and she told the beavers that the eagles had stolen their precious wood. She told the deer who had killed her fawn, and she told the tall spruce who had carved a cuss word into its bark. Once again, everyone in the forest asked the Big Frog to keep quiet, for now everyone had a grudge against everyone else.

And if it works, why, you will be the most beautiful creature in the whole of the forest.” With visions of his splendid coat in mind, the Muskrat jumped in. "

msgid "The goblins scarfed the crabs, but when they finished, they found that they were still hungry.  “She won’t miss a handful of shrimp,” said one goblin to the other. The goblins scarfed the shrimp, but when they finished, they found that they were still hungry. “Maybe also a few scallops?” said one goblin to the other. The goblins scarfed the scallops, but when they were finished, they found that they were still hungry. So, they went back for clams, and then urchins, and finally even the sea cucumber. Finally, they were not hungry, but there was also nothing left. Just then, the Pelican woke up. “What happened to my food?” she asked. Unable to lie about it, the goblins confessed their crime. The Pelican was dismayed, but she was a charitable-hearted bird, and she could tell the crafty goblins were growing little creatures."

msgid "The goblins wiggled and cried out, but the sack remained shut as their captor stomped through the forest, singing, “Widdle diddle dum, widdle diddle dee, in this bag’s a meal for me!” After a lot of thumping and thudding, the bag opened, and the goblins were dumped into a giant iron pot full of warming water. A huge troll stood overhead, grinning down at them through long bushy white eyebrows. “I am the Ice Troll, and you are my dinner.” He readied to cook the goblins, singing, “Widdle diddle dum, dum de dee, there’s soon to be a soup for me!” Finishing his diddy, he bent over to stoke the fire beneath the pot and let out a loud noise of pain, rubbing a spot on his back that always ached. The troll stood painfully and walked over to a stone shelf, where he began to chop potatoes."

msgid "The next morning, the Princess went to retrieve her gown from the clothing line and found that it was gone. She immediately suspected the goblins of mischief and called, “Goblins! Did you take my gown?” The goblins emerged from their cave and nodded sadly. “Now what I will wear?” asked the Princess, sad and angry that she had lost her only dress. “Let us explain,” said the goblins. So, they told the Princess the story of the Mad Hunter, and then they produced his clothing, which was a bit large for the Princess but much warmer than her beautiful gown. She immediately forgave them. “Thank you, my friends,” she said. “For rescuing me, and for this clothing, which will keep me much warmer in the winter than my beautiful gown.” <lf><lf>The Mad Hunter was forced to remain below the lake with the Moon Hag, but she did not kill him, because even reduced to just one hand, he was too useful a servant. Lo, he plotted the day he would emerge, to once again hunt the wise Princess and earn back his left hand.<lf><lf>And that is the story of how the crafty goblins rescued the wise Princess from the Mad Hunter."
msgstr ""

msgid "The princess dried her eyes and smiled at the two goblins, “If we were friends, we could share the cake you stole from me.” The two thieves spat and smirked, \"\"A friend? What is that?\"\" The princess frowned, for she realized that the two tiny thieves were as lonely as she was. “A friend is someone you love and care for. Someone you would never hurt.” \"\"We never hurt each other, and we care for each other,\"\" said the goblins at the same time. \"\"Does that mean we are friends?\"\" \"\"Yes, that's exactly it.\"\" “And if we were friends, you would not hurt us?” “Of course not. Friends trust each other.” The goblins shook their little heads. “We trust no one, for no one trust us.” "

msgid "The storm intensified, and the Pelican was in a total whiteout. She knew she should have despaired, but all she could feel was the weight, which had grown and grown until she thought she might drop out of the sky. She had felt called to help the Princess and the Goblins, but she had ignored it. “I should have stayed,” she thought. “It was the right thing to do, and now I’m lost, with no way to make it right.”<lf>Suddenly, she was plucked from the sky and deposited in the hall of the Ice King. “Pelican,” he said. “You were flying in circles around my mountain.” “I was lost,” she said, “weighted down by the weight of guilt in my heart.” The Ice King stared at her sagely. “Is it guilt, or is it something else? Open your beak.” He reached down inside of her, pulling out a glowing stone. The Pious Pelican was surprised at how it filled her with warmth, chasing away cold and her doubt. “You know what you must do,” said the Ice King."

msgid "The time came to go, and the Pelican struggled to take flight. It felt as though a leaden weight were stuck right in the center of her chest. “What can I do?” she thought. “I’m a migratory bird. And if I were to stay, who would look after my flock?” She managed to take off, but only just barely, flapping fiercely to catch up with the other birds.<lf>As the Pious Pelican began her journey, the storm picked up, battering her to and fro. She had fallen well behind the flock, and she was already growing tired. But for all her challenges in the air, she could tell things were much worse on the ground: a deep freeze had settled over the forest. The leaden weight in her chest grew heavier as she thought of the Princess and the Goblins. “What can I do?” she thought. “I’m a migratory bird. And if I were to stay, who would look after my flock?”"

msgid "The wise Princess decided more precision was needed. She thought then of the Very Old Beaver, who kept an excellently crafted dam. “Perhaps she can help.” She went looking for the Very Old Beaver and found the industrious animal hard at work slapping down mud on a part of her dam that had been blown apart in the storm. Most of the structure was unharmed, because the Beaver was very good at building things. The Princess knew she had come to the right place. “Beaver,” she said, “my house was damaged in the storm. Would you help me fix it?” “I believe I could do that, yes,” said the Very Old Beaver, and she paused at fixing her own den to follow the Princess. <lf>The Very Old Beaver examined the big wooden house and nodded. “It will be an easy fix,” she said, and she set about righting the post with loud slaps of her tail. When she was done, the wise Princess stroked the Beaver’s head. “Thank you, Beaver,” she said. “The wind blew the shingles off the roof, and the planks off the walls, and even bent this post.  Now, thanks to you, I still have a home.” “Think nothing of it,” said the Very Old Beaver, who returned to work on her own den once again."
msgstr ""

msgid "Their words made the Princess cry again, for now she understood that the two creatures were not only as lonely as she was here in the big wooden house but they had been lonely since they were born. \"\"You are making that noise again,\"\" frowned the goblins. \"\"Please stop that, for it makes us feel unhappy. Are you a witch? Is this some sort of magic?\"\" \"\"It makes you unhappy because we are friends,\"\" said the Princess. “But we don’t know you, and you’re not like us.” \"\"Sometimes, friendship comes right away, even between people who are very different.\"\" \"\"Does it mean we can’t steal from you anymore?\"\" \"\"Yes.\"\" “But that's what we do! We are the crafty goblins who live under your house.” “Well, then, maybe, we could arrange something.” “Is that what friends do?” “Yes, I believe they do.”<lf>And this is how the Princess met the crafty goblins, and how they became friends."
msgstr ""

msgid "There they found the Princess preparing food. They tried to peer into her mind, but they found it was a blank. They tried to speak to her using only their own minds, but she could not hear them. It seemed the Secret Keeper was craftier than the crafty goblins, for she had only shared enough of her power to let the goblins use the Gift of Voice with each other and not with the whole of the forest. <lf>And that is how the goblins stole the Gift of Voice from the Secret Keeper, but why they could only use it with each other."
msgstr ""

msgid "They chipped away at the glacier until they had filled a basket full of ice, then hid once more behind their boulder and started tossing chunks of it on the sleeping bear. Now, Old Bear was not the smartest creature in the forest. So, when he woke up covered in ice, he roared, “My cave is collapsing!” Then he lumbered to his feet and ran outside before the whole thing could come down on top of him. <lf>The goblins crept out after him and did a loop before coming back to “find” him sitting outside. “What happened?” they asked. “My cave! It’s collapsing,” bemoaned the Old Bear. “And it’s time for me to hibernate. Where will I stay for the winter?” It had not occurred to the goblins that the Old Bear had settled in for the winter, and they felt a little bad. But they did not want the Old Bear to know what they had done, so instead, they offered to help him find a new den. Together, they searched. They inspected cavernous stone and hollowed trees and deeply pocketed knolls. Nothing they found was as beautiful as the ice cave, but the Old Bear settled on a packed earthen hollow that would keep him warm and dry for his long sleep. “Good night,” he yawned, and the goblins gleefully returned to their new home."

msgid "They led the Mad Hunter to the edge of the deep and icy lake, and when he came into view, they weighed the fake Princess down with stones and dropped her into the frigid water, careful not to plunge into the depths themselves, lest the Moon Hag take her revenge on them. The Mad Hunter removed his clothing and dove in after the fake Princess. He followed the shape of the sinking Princess deep into the chilly water, down below where ice covered the lake’s surface. Finally, he caught her, but when he spun her toward him, he realized she had no head and that her body was stuffed with straw. And then he felt a slippery fin brush his shoulder as the Moon Hag loomed overhead."
msgstr ""

msgid "This made sense to the Troll. The spot on his back that always ached was still bothering him, and the goblins couldn’t go anywhere if they were trapped. So, he stuffed the goblins back in the sack and climbed into the soup pot. He stretched out and let out a sigh of contentment. Meanwhile, the goblins threw themselves around in the sack until it began to swing. The troll was so relaxed, he didn’t even notice. The bag dropped onto the shelf where the troll had been chopping potatoes, and the goblins pushed it up against the edge of the troll’s knife, sawing a hole. Then they made a break for it. The troll finally noticed what they were doing and roared out in anger, but he was so relaxed that when he tried to chase them, he tumbled out of the cook pot and into the flames, catching his bushy eyebrows on fire.<lf>The goblins ran and ran and ran as fast as they could through the ancient and deep forest, until they were back in their cave and safe in their beds. They vowed never to venture out in the ancient and deep forest late at night again, for they did not think they’d get so lucky as to trick the Ice Troll twice.<lf>And that is the story of how the Crafty Goblins met the Ice Troll, and why they never did again."

msgid "When he emerged, he was disappointed to find that nothing had changed. “Hmm,” said one goblin. “Maybe you have to be stung by the hornets first! Just like us.” The Muskrat hesitated, because getting stung would be painful. Seeing his hesitation, the goblin added, “If it works, you will be the most beautiful creature in the whole of the forest.” The Muskrat decided it was worth it. So, he returned to the hornet's nest and pitched a stone right at it. The hornets emerged, even more furious this time. They chased the Muskrat, stinging him repeatedly, until he jumped into the magic pool.<lf>The Muskrat was disappointed to find that, once again, nothing had changed. \"\"I wonder if the magic only works for us,” said one of the goblins. “Would you like me to jump in with your coat?” The Muskrat hesitated. “If it works, you will be the most beautiful creature in the whole of the forest.” With visions of his splendid coat in mind, the Muskrat agreed. He slipped it off and handed it to the goblins. Without his coat, the Muskrat was pale and covered in scabbing welts. Instead of jumping in the pool, one of the goblins ran away with the coat, laughing. The other pushed Muskrat into the frigid pool, and as water splashed the goblin, the gold flecks ran, revealing that they had only ever been painted on."

msgid "When he had finally managed to squish or scare them all off, the Old Bear heard someone laughing. The Crafty Goblins had seen the whole thing. “Clumsy Old Bear!” they teased. “Those big old paws aren’t good at anything, are they?” Then they sped off, leaving Old Bear’s pride hurting just as bad as his body.<lf>He lumbered through the forest, hungry and sad. “Maybe I am just a clumsy old bear,” he moaned, “and my big old paws aren’t good at anything.” <lf>At that moment, the Old Bear heard a sad, sad noise. “What’s that?” he wondered, and he followed the sound to where a mountain goat stood atop a boulder high up a hillside. “Old Baaaah-er!” she cried. “Old Bear, please help! My kid is stuck!”"

msgid "When they were all safe, the Very Old Beaver thanked the goblins. “But how,” she asked, “did you know just where to find me? And how did you know that branch was coming?” The goblins shared a secret smile. “Just lucky, I guess!” they said.<lf>And that is how the goblins saved the Very Old Beaver from the flooding river, and how she never knew how they did it."
msgstr ""

msgid "When they were done, they returned to the Pious Pelican. “Did it feel good being as generous as I am?” asked the Pelican. “It did!” said the goblins. “I’m glad,” said the Pelican. “We all have problems that we can’t solve on our own, but if everyone goes about with generosity in their hearts, then there is always someone on hand to help. But we all must commit to do so, or there may be no one there to help you when you need it.” This made sense to the goblins, and they thanked the Pious Pelican for her food and the lesson. Of course, by this time, they were hungry again, and that remained an on-going problem until the day the Stalwart Moose taught them to fish, but that is another story.<lf>And that is how the Pious Pelican forgave the Crafty Goblins, and how she taught them charity."
msgstr ""

msgid "“Brother!” she cried out through the Gift. “You’re coming up on a low hanging branch. You’ll zip by it quickly, but if you’re fast enough…” “Got it!” said her brother, and then he said to the Beaver, “Get ready to grab ahold of a low hanging branch! We’re going to zip by it quickly, but if we’re fast enough…” Suddenly, they were right in front of it and reached out, snagging hold. Though the water beat against them, trying to shake them loose, they pulled themselves along the branch, back to dry land."
msgstr ""

msgid "“Goblins,” said the Pious Pelican. “I will share my food with you, but you must, in return, follow my example and be as generous with others as I am with you. Take that to heart, and I will have considered your debt paid.” “But we have nothing to give!” said the goblins. “You have your nimble hands and your crafty brains and your loving hearts,” said the pelican. The Crafty Goblins realized how much they had to give, and for the rest of the day, they looked for ways to help the other creatures of the forest. <lf>They found the Stalwart Moose struggling with an itchy, hard-to-reach spot on his back, and so they climbed up and gave it a good scratching. Next, they helped the Old Bear, who could not get the honey out of a narrow beehive. They climbed up to the top of a tree with the hive, and then dropped it, cracking it open. Finally, they found the Princess, crying over a loss she would not speak about. So, they wrapped their little arms around her in a great big hug and stayed until she felt better. "
msgstr ""

msgid "“Thank you!” gushed the mama goat, and she and her kid bounded off up the mountain. The Old Bear watched them go with a smile, and then made his way back down the hillside, wiggling his rump in triumph as he went. To his surprise, the Crafty Goblins waited at the bottom of the hill.<lf>“We saw the whole thing,” they said. “We were wrong. You aren’t just a clumsy old bear, and your paws are good for helping others.”"
